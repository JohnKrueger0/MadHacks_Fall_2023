           <h1>The Impact on Students</h1>

           <h2>1. Sorting Times</h2>
           <p>
               One of the key features of the scheduler web app is the ability to sort class times efficiently. 
               This functionality greatly simplifies the course selection process for students. 
               By providing a user-friendly interface that allows sorting based on preferred times, 
               students can easily identify and choose classes that fit their schedules. 
               This not only enhances the overall user experience but also contributes to better 
               time management for students.
           </p>

           <h2>2. Class GPA Averages</h2>
           <p>
               Another impactful feature of the scheduler web app is the ability to display 
               class GPA averages. This information empowers students to make informed decisions 
               about their course selection by considering the historical performance of each class. 
               By having access to GPA data, students can prioritize courses that align with their 
               academic goals and interests. This feature promotes a more strategic and personalized 
               approach to building class schedules.
           </p>

           <h2>3. Selecting Days for Classes</h2>
           <p>
               The scheduler web app also allows students to choose specific days for 
               their classes. This flexibility is invaluable for individuals with varying 
               commitments and preferences. Students can tailor their schedules to align with 
               their weekly routines, ensuring a balanced and manageable workload. The ability 
               to select days for classes contributes to a more customized and adaptive learning 
               experience, accommodating the diverse needs of the student body.
           </p>

           <p>
               In conclusion, the scheduler web app significantly enhances the course selection 
               process for students. With features like sorting times, displaying class GPA 
               averages, and selecting days for classes, the app empowers students to make well-informed
                decisions and create personalized schedules that align with their academic 
                and personal priorities.
           </p>
         <h3>Details of the implementations</h2>
         <p> 
             The tools and frameworks we use here include MongoDB 
             to store schedules and courses which also utilizes Google Cloud 
             Platform that processes these inputes. We are using GitHub 
             pages to host the site. We webscraped every single course in the 
             Course Search and Enroll as well as scraped Madgrades for GPAs for our datasets.
